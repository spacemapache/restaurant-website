    <h2>About Fiish</h2>
    <div class="about-fiish">
      Welcome to Fiish, a sustainable sushi restaurant – at Platform LA in
      Culver City. With nearly two decades of experience cultivating
      relationships with local seafood purveyors and farmers, we source the
      majority of our fish directly from local docks and sustainable aquaculture
      farms. We work exclusively with farms that have Aquaculture Stewardship
      Council (ASC) certifications and have earned a Best Aquaculture Practices
      (BAP) rating, which measure traceability, environmental impact, and pen
      densities, among other variables. Our seasonal menu will focus only on
      premium line-caught, ethically-sourced fish from local docks and
      sustainable aquaculture farms that we treat and dry age in-house. Once we
      receive our fresh catch, we process the fish and hang them in our on-site
      dry aging refrigeration system, where we age the fish for 5-12 days,
      depending on the species. This short dry-aging process not only allows us
      to serve premium, never-frozen seafood, but also allows our chefs
      elasticity in the supply chain, resulting in reliable stock and minimal
      loss. We are surfers, we are divers, and we are fishermen. Fiish is a
      celebration of the coast and spirit of California that we are so
      passionate about.
